# TinyMMO Login Server

>Secure login and registration service for the TinyMMO game using a challenge-response protocol.
> Built with **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL** and **Redis**.

---

## Overview

This service handles secure user registration and authentication without transmitting plaintext passwords.
It uses a **challenge-response login system** that ensures credentials are never exposed over the network.

Key Features:

* Secure challenge-response authentication using Argon2, HKDF, and ChaCha20-Poly1305
* REST and WebSocket login endpoints
* PostgreSQL-backed user repository
<!-- * Full test suite with `pytest` will be in future-->
